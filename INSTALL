# HOW TO USE PROVIDED VAGRANT IMAGES

* Head over to http://downloads.vagrantup.com/tags/v1.2.2 and download the appropriate installer for your platform then install vagrant with the downloaded file.
* Check-out vagrant folder in devel branch.
* Checkout used submodules for puppet

$ cd NoteClipper
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

* Enter vagrant folder in your copy

$ cd vagrant

* Rename the desired distribution vagrant config file. i.e.:

$ cp Vagrantfile-fedora-18-i386 Vagrantfile

* Issue vagrant up command. Vagrant will download the base image from internet and use the provided puppet configuration to prepare the environment to run the project.

$ vagrant up

* A virtualbox machine with GUI will be started and vagrant user will be auto logged in. Start a terminal and run NoteClipper.
